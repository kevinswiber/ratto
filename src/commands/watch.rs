//! One loop, N sources: the shared frame engine behind `rat watch`
//! (one source, no box) and — through the same `run_registry` — any
//! registry of sources. The iteration order is law: signals →
//! spawn-if-due → drain-then-compose-once → triggers → nap → age
//! refresh → theme verify → events. The drain terminates because each
//! source has at most one tick in flight; nothing ever paints inside
//! it, and nothing outside this file writes to the terminal. Pane
//! gestures — focus, zoom, collapse, per-pane scroll — exist for
//! `Composition::Panes` registries in a live frame only, and thread
//! through one `PaneView` and one `derive_geometry`; `action_for`
//! still takes no pane — dispatch resolves the target from the focus.

//! Run one configured watch child to completion — inline or on a

//! The outcome carries its source tag and exit status, because one
//! loop drains N sources and a pane names the code its command exited
//! with.
//!
//! The slot's protocol is the heart: the worker checks the shutdown
//! bar and spawns/parks under ONE critical section (the lock spans
//! the spawn), while `shutdown` takes the same lock — so it either
//! kills a parked child or bars a spawn that has not happened yet.
//! There is no window in between. The supersede verb rides the same
//! lock with a gentler ladder — TERM now, a generation-guarded force
//! at its grace bound — while `shutdown` stays kill-only, because the
//! way out must not wait.
